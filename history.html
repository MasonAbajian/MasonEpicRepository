                    History is kinda epic. The most epic. Can't get anymore epic than history because it's just so epic. Sometimes I dream about history and think to myself on how epic history is. I can't get enough of history.

                    History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation")[2] is the study of the past as it is described in written documents.[3][4] Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.
